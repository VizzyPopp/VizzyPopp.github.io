  <h1>Viz's Favorite Games, Movies, and Music</h1>
  <hr/>
  
  <p> 
     This page is all about a few of my favorite things. I manage to find most of these interests
	 from suggestions from other people in my life whether it be online or in person. Of course, 
	 it's with the help of the internet most times. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
     For games, I prefer playing casual where I can play alone, but sometimes I play with my friends
	 and if I do it's usually accesible by everyone. For movies I usually end up finding them on my own
	 through looking at the selection on whatever streaming service I'm using but sometimes I find them
	 talked about online first. Lastly, for songs I find them through other people but the majority
	 of new songs I find are reccomended to me through Spotify's algorithm.

  <dl>
    <dt>Collard Greens - ScHoolboy Q, Kendrick Lamar</dt>
	<dd>The first song I played when I got my car. I could never get tired of it no matter how much I listen to it.</dd>
	
	<dt>Excursions - A Tribe Called Quest</dt>
	<dd>I found this song on Twitter one day while I was scrolling and decided to listen to it. I mostly like the music more than the lyrics.</dd>
	
	<dt>Chove Chuva - Jorge Ben Jor</dt>
	<dd>One year I was in the top 10% of listeners for spotify's DJ and this song played which I ended up adoring.</dd>
