  <h2>The movie</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
       <u>Train to Busan</u> is a South Korean action horror film 
       starring actors like <em>Gong Yoo</em>, who recently appeared 
	   in <u>Squid Games season 2</u>, and <em>Ma Dong-seok</em>, South Korea's 
	   John Wick, among others. The movie, directed by <em>Yeon Sang-ho</em>, 
	   was "the first Korean film of 2016 to break the audience record of over
	   <strong>10 million</strong> theatergoers" which was declared on <em>August 7th</em>.

  <h2>The plot</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
	   The movie follows fund manager <em>Seok-woo</em>, who is found out to be a 
	   workaholic and a divorced father of his daughter <em>Su-an</em>. He is skeptical
	   and initially refusing <em>Su-an's</em> request to spend her birthday with her
	   mother in Busan, Korea, but upon witnessing a video of <em>Su-an</em> attempting
	   to sing at her singing recital but succumbing to stage fright as a result
	   of <em>Seok-woo</em> not showing up, he decides to grant her wish and take her
	   to Busan.

	<p>
	   So the next day, the both of them head to Seoul Station and whilst <em>Seok-woo</em> is asleep, <em>Su-an</em>
	   sneaks passed her father to go and use the restroom on the farther side of 
	   the train. But as this is happening, a girl stumbles onto the train, twitching and
	   foaming at the mouth with a bite wound on her leg. When the girl collapses to the 
	   ground seemingly passed out, a nearby attendent rushes to her aid, turning her back
	   as she radios in the incident. Unfortunately though, the girl slowly rises off of 
	   the ground in a hungry and inhuman state, lunging at the attendent.

	<p>
	   A zombie outbreak has ensued across most if not all of South Korea, and it had reached 
	   <em>Seok-woo</em> and <em>Su-an</em>. Throughout the movie the viewer watches as new
	   characters are introduced: good and bad, growing a likeness or dislikeness to 
	   the new characters. At one point families are separated before coming together 
	   and fighting through the zombies as best as they can to get to Busan. Not all make 
	   it there, but by the end of the movie the viewer had gone through a roller coaster
	   of emotions, sitting and soaking in the movie that is <u>Train to Busan</u>

  <h2>The zombies</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
	   In American pop culture, zombies are most represented as slow, limping and dead as they mindlessly roam 
	   in search of people. In this movie, however, the zombies are <em>fast</em> and a reminicent of spider monkeys.
	   The entire military at one point turned into zombies, and they run and tackle at <em>lightning speed</em> and 
	   the zombies at the end of the movie create a human chain onto the back of the train, climbing and holding
	   onto each other. Yet, besides the fact that the zombies are undeniably <strong>deadly</strong>, they appear to not have the
	   best sight or smell as they can't actively seek people out with their nose and when it's dark, they don't 
	   appear to register anything.
